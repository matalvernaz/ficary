"""Notification dispatchers for the watchlist feature.

Three channels are supported:

* **Pushover** — mobile push via https://api.pushover.net/. The user
  configures an application token (per-app secret) and a user/group key
  (per-account id) in the GUI.
* **Discord** — incoming webhook URL pasted from a channel's integration
  settings. No credentials needed beyond the webhook itself.
* **Email** — re-uses the SMTP config from :mod:`ffn_dl.mailer` that
  ``--send-to-kindle`` already relies on, so the user only configures
  SMTP once.

The module is deliberately self-contained: it uses only the standard
library's :mod:`urllib.request` for HTTP, so we don't drag the scraper's
``curl_cffi`` dependency into the notification path. Notification volume
is low (a few requests per poll), so the extra features of curl_cffi
would be wasted here.

The public entry point is :func:`dispatch`, which fans a single
:class:`Notification` out to every requested channel and collects
per-channel failures so the caller — the watchlist poll runner — can
keep going when one channel is misconfigured. :class:`NotificationError`
is raised by the per-channel ``send_*`` helpers on failure; ``dispatch``
catches those and never re-raises.
