        Site scrapers whose chapter pages are each a separate fetch
        (FicWad, Royal Road, MediaMiner) used to open-code this loop —
        it's the same shape every time: honour ``skip_chapters`` /
        ``chapter_spec``, load what's cached, batch the rest through
        ``_fetch_parallel``, parse through the site-specific body
        extractor, and cache on the way out. Consolidating it here
        means per-site changes (retry-on-parse-error, richer progress
        reporting, a different cache layout) land in one place.

        The helper is intentionally narrow: it doesn't do metadata,
        URL normalisation, or author-page handling. Scrapers whose
        chapter 1 body lives on the metadata page (FFN, TGStorytime,
        AO3) don't fit this shape — they handle ch1 directly from the
        already-fetched soup and would have to be re-architected to
        use the helper, which isn't worth the change.

            story_id: Cache key passed to
                ``_load_chapter_cache`` / ``_save_chapter_cache``.

                dicts. List position (1-indexed) is the chapter number.

            skip_chapters: Chapters 1..``skip_chapters`` are dropped
                before fetching — the update-mode optimisation.
            chapter_spec: The ``--chapters`` range list, or ``None``
                to download everything. Forwarded to
                :func:`~ffn_dl.models.chapter_in_spec`.
            parse_chapter: Callable ``(BeautifulSoup) -> str`` that
                pulls the chapter HTML out of a fetched page. Usually
                the scraper's ``_parse_chapter_html`` bound method.
            progress_callback: Optional
                ``(chap_num, total, title, from_cache)`` reporter.
            total: Chapter count used for progress display — a
                progress bar wants the real upstream count even when
                only a subset is being downloaded. Defaults to
