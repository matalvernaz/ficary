"""Scraper-cache doctor — report and prune stale cache entries.

The per-story chapter cache lives at ``~/.cache/ffn-dl/<site>_<id>/``
and accumulates forever unless something explicitly cleans it. Over
time a library manager run from a few years' worth of downloads
builds up thousands of entries — including caches for stories that
have since been deleted from the library, renamed upstream, or that
were one-offs the user doesn't want anymore.

This module walks the cache dir and produces a report: total size,
per-site distribution, largest-N entries, and (optionally) entries
that don't appear in any known library index. The CLI wires this up
as ``--cache-doctor``; pass ``--prune`` to remove orphans.

The module never touches the library index or the files on disk in
the library — it's strictly a cache-hygiene tool. The per-run cache
corruption path in :class:`~ffn_dl.scraper.BaseScraper` already
self-heals by deleting a bad cache entry on read; this doctor covers
the slower leak: orphans from deleted / renamed / dropped stories
that no read ever triggers.
