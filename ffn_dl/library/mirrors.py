"""Cross-site mirror detection for the library index.

The same story often lives on two (or three) sites — an FFN original
mirrored to AO3, a Literotica serial crossposted to StoriesOnline,
etc. The library index treats each URL as its own story, so a
``--library-stats`` view counts the work twice, ``--update-library``
probes both copies, and the user can accidentally read or audiobook
a stale mirror without knowing the other copy has newer chapters.

This module produces a list of *candidate* mirror pairs. It never
deletes — false positives on common titles ("The Dragon", "Untitled")
are inevitable on signal-strength heuristics, so acting on the
output is always the user's call.

Signal model (destructive-heuristics rule applies: ≥2 signals
required before flagging):

1. **Normalised title match.** Lowercase, strip punctuation, collapse
   whitespace, then compare token sets. Exact match or Jaccard
   similarity ≥ 0.85 counts.
2. **Normalised author match.** Same treatment as title; punctuation
   differences between sites (pen name on one, underscore on the
   other) still collapse to a match.
3. **First-chapter word overlap.** Extract the first chapter's plain
   text from each local file and compare unique-word sets. An overlap
   ≥ 0.6 counts. Cheap on a cached library — we already have the
   files on disk from the original downloads.

Cross-site constraint: candidates must live on *different* registered
scrapers. Within-site duplicates are the library-doctor's
``duplicate_relpaths`` territory — surfacing them here would muddle
the "possible mirror" signal.
