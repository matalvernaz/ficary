"""Watchlist integrity check and self-heal.

The watchlist accumulates entries over months or years of use. Sites
drop supported status (rarely, but it happens), users paste URLs the
scraper doesn't recognise yet, and the JSON file's edit-by-hand
affordance means an entry can end up with garbage in ``type`` or
``site``. None of those cause a crash on load — the store quarantines
unreadable files but accepts individually-malformed entries — and
none of them surface at poll time beyond a quiet "scraper not
found" in the log that's easy to miss on a 200-entry watchlist.

This module produces a structured report of what's wrong, and an
opt-in heal that drops unrepairable entries. Mirrors the shape of
:mod:`ffn_dl.library.doctor` so anyone who's used the library
version can read this without friction.
