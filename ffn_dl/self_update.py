"""GitHub-release self-update for the portable Windows build.

Uses the ZipExtractor.exe pattern popularised by Libation /
ravibpatel's AutoUpdater.NET: we ship a tiny signed helper .exe
next to ffn-dl.exe, copy it to ``%TEMP%`` so it isn't locked in the
install dir, spawn it via ``ShellExecuteW`` (with UAC elevation only
when the install dir isn't user-writable), and exit. The helper
waits for our process handle via ``Process.WaitForExit``, extracts
the update zip over the install with Windows Restart Manager-based
locked-file diagnosis, writes a ``ZipExtractor.log`` to its own
directory, and relaunches ffn-dl.exe.

The old approach (batch script + ``tasklist`` polling + ``robocopy``)
was fragile for several reasons — silent failures, no logging,
Defender heuristics on batch-in-%TEMP%-touching-files-elsewhere, no
UAC path. All of those go away here.

Helper source: ravibpatel/AutoUpdater.NET v1.9.2 (MIT). Built from
source in CI; see ``.github/workflows/build-windows.yml``.
