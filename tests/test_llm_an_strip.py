"""Tests for the LLM author's-note backstop on the export pipeline.

These exercise :func:`ficary.exporters.strip_an_via_llm` end-to-end
with the underlying ``attribution._llm_call`` stubbed out, so we
never make a real network round-trip during testing. The stub lets
us:

* Pin the cache hit / cache miss branching.
* Verify that the runaway threshold triggers the verification round
  instead of just dropping the LLM result.
* Check the user-facing rule the user asked for: when verification
  retracts every flag, the chapter content stays intact rather than
  being declared "worthless" by the first pass alone.
* Confirm graceful degradation when the LLM transport fails — the
  regex-only output is what callers get back, never an exception.
