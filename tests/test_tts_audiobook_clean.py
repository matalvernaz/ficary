"""Regression tests for audiobook-mode text cleanup.

Author's notes and scene dividers are disasters when read aloud by TTS —
"A/N" becomes "slash n", "* * *" becomes "asterisk asterisk asterisk",
and fanfic authors invent a new divider glyph every Tuesday ("oOo",
"xXx", "o0o", em-dash runs). These tests lock in that the audiobook
pipeline strips notes, drops an <hr/> into a pause, and normalises
every text-based divider we've seen in the wild to the same pause.
