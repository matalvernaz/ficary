"""Headless GUI smoke test.

Boots ``MainFrame`` plus the satellite frames (Search, Watchlist,
Library) under a wx ``App`` and tears them down. Catches the class
of regression that AST-level checks miss: a Bind() that referenced
a renamed handler, a menu item with an empty label, an event
handler that crashes during initial-state setup, a satellite frame
constructor whose signature drifted away from its caller.

Skips silently when:

* wxPython isn't installed (CI without GTK headers, or a CLI-only
  install). The test is a pure correctness signal — environments
  that can't render shouldn't fail it.
* ``DISPLAY`` isn't set (no X server, no xvfb-run wrapper). On
  Linux CI this means ``xvfb-run pytest`` or installing
  ``pytest-xvfb``; locally a workstation already has a display.
