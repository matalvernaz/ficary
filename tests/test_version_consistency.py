"""Guard the two-place version invariant.

``ficary/__init__.py`` exposes ``__version__`` to the running app
(self-updater reads it to decide whether a GitHub release is newer).
``pyproject.toml`` drives the CI build and tag. They MUST match, or
the self-updater sees its own installed build as older than the one
it just downloaded and loops forever. 1.23.10 shipped with the two
values out of sync and bricked the auto-update flow for everyone
who upgraded; this test prevents that regression.
