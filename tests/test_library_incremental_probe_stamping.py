"""Regression tests for incremental last_probed stamping.

Before this feature, ``last_probed`` got stamped in one shot at the
very end of a library update. A user who closed the app during a
long probe cycle (800+ FFN stories at 6 s/probe = ~80 minutes) lost
every stamp, so the *next* Check for Updates re-probed every story
they had already checked. These tests guard against that regression:

* ``_run_update_queue`` fires ``on_probe_complete(url, remote_count)``
  for every successful probe, never for failures. The ``remote_count``
  is ``None`` when the probe answered with "story gone" so the
  pending-download marker is cleared cleanly.
* Pending stamps get flushed to the index in batches so a partial
  run leaves persistent progress on disk.
