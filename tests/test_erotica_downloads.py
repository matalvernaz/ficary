"""End-to-end download tests for the erotica subpackage.

Every scraper's :meth:`download` path runs against a real HTML page
we've captured as a fixture — no network, no mocks of parsers. We
only stub :meth:`BaseScraper._fetch` so each ``GET`` returns the
right fixture for the requested URL, and then assert that the
produced :class:`Story` object has a sensible title, author,
metadata, and non-empty chapter bodies.

Why this shape: the sanity check during development revealed two
parse bugs (AFF's author link pattern changed; GreatFeet's title
carried a boilerplate suffix) that the URL-parsing tests wouldn't
have caught. Running the full download loop against a fixture is
what gives us coverage of ``_parse_metadata``, ``_parse_chapter_html``,
and the cache/delay control-flow all at once.
