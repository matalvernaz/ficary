"""Unified "Erotic Story Search" — fans out across every erotica site.

The existing per-site SearchFrame pattern (see :mod:`ficary.gui_search`)
gives one window per site. Erotica is different: the user's primary
axis is **the kink/tag**, not the site, so a single search window that
queries every erotica archive at once and returns merged results gives
a better experience than eight sidebar entries.

Public entry points:

* ``search_erotica(query, sites=None, tags=None, ...)`` — fan-out to
  every registered erotica site in parallel, merge the results, tag
  each row with its origin ``site`` so the GUI's "Site" column can
  display where each hit came from.
* ``EROTICA_SITE_SLUGS`` / ``EROTICA_TAG_VOCABULARY`` — metadata the
  GUI binds its dropdowns / tag picker to.

Per-site search functions here are deliberately small — Literotica's
native search already lives in :mod:`ficary.search` (imported below),
and the newer sites all expose a category or tag URL we can parse as
a result list without a real search API. Nothing here tries to be a
full-blown search engine: the point is to give the user a one-stop
discovery surface over all eight archives, not to replicate each
site's native filter set.

Tag search is a first-class input (per user feedback — see
``feedback_erotica_search.md`` in auto-memory). The unified vocabulary
below is the *intersection* of tags that appear meaningfully on ≥3 of
the 8 sites; niche per-site tags still work as free-text entries.

# slug — most of them — gets a 0-result fallback page silently).
#
# Returning ``None`` from :func:`_translate_tag` is a signal that the

# as "skip this site for this tag" rather than degrading to a default
# browse that would flood the result set with off-topic rows.
#
# Layout: ``_TAG_SLUGS[site][vocab_tag] = site_specific_slug``.
# Missing entries fall through to :func:`_translate_tag`'s default
# behaviour: vocab tag → passthrough for sites where the slug shape
# usually matches our vocab (literotica), or ``None`` for sites where
# an unmapped tag would never resolve (everything else).

    Rationale: the GUI's SearchFrame treats search results as a plain
    ``list[dict]`` (so ``fetch_until_limit`` can iterate without
    knowing which site it's talking to), but the unified search also
    needs to surface *per-site* health — how many hits each archive
    returned, which ones failed, and which ones are exhausted. Rather
    than break the contract or thread a second return value through
    ``fetch_until_limit``, we subclass ``list`` and hang the stats
    dict off an attribute. Callers that don't care keep seeing a list
    of dicts; the erotica SearchFrame peeks at ``.site_stats`` for
    the summary panel and ``.exhausted_sites`` for load-more gating.

    ``total_sites`` is the set of every site the initial search
    considered eligible — the canonical denominator for "have we
    exhausted everything?". The GUI used to compute this from
    ``len(site_stats)``, but on Load More the new call's
    ``site_stats`` only includes the currently-active sites (the ones
    not yet exhausted via ``skip_sites``), so the comparison would
    falsely trigger end-of-results. Tracking the canonical set on the
    result object keeps the GUI's exhaustion check honest.
