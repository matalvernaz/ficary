"""Portable-build path resolution.

The Windows release ships as a zip that unpacks to a single folder:

    ficary/
      ficary.exe              <- sys.executable when frozen
      _internal/              <- PyInstaller bundle
      settings.ini            <- GUI preferences (was: Windows registry)
      cache/                  <- chapter cache (was: ~/.cache/ficary)
        huggingface/          <- HF Hub model downloads (via HF_HOME)
      neural/
        py/                   <- embedded Python for neural backends
        deps/                 <- pip-installed neural backends
      booknlp_models/         <- BookNLP weights (was: ~/booknlp_models)

``portable_root()`` returns the folder everything should live in. For a
frozen build that's the exe's directory when it's writable; if the user
unzipped into something read-only like ``C:\\Program Files\\`` we fall
back to ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\ficary\\`` so the app still works. For a
pip-installed ficary we return ``~/.ficary/`` so the two install flavors
don't stomp on each other's data.

``setup_env()`` is called once from :mod:`ficary.__init__` before any
other submodule is imported. It creates the root directory and — only
for frozen builds — overrides ``HOME``/``USERPROFILE`` so third-party
libraries that resolve ``~`` (notably BookNLP, which hardcodes
``~/booknlp_models``) land inside the portable folder rather than the
user's actual home directory.
