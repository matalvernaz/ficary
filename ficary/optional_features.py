"""Runtime installer for ficary's optional PyPI extras.

Attribution backends (BookNLP, fastcoref) already have an inline
install button driven by :mod:`ficary.attribution` +
:mod:`ficary.neural_env`. The other optional extras declared in
``pyproject.toml`` — ``epub``, ``audio``, ``clipboard``, ``cf-solve``
— had no GUI story: a pip-installed user could run ``pip install
'ficary[all]'`` but a frozen-Windows user had no way in.

This module gives every optional extra the same install pathway the
attribution backends use:

* **pip-installed ficary** shells out to ``sys.executable -m pip
  install <pkg>``.
* **Frozen Windows build** routes through :mod:`ficary.neural_env`,
  which lazily downloads an embeddable CPython and pip-installs into
  a user-writable ``deps/`` folder that ``ficary/__init__.py`` adds to
  ``sys.path`` at startup.

Each feature optionally declares a ``post_install`` command — the
arguments to pass to the Python interpreter after the pip install
step. ``cf-solve`` uses this to run ``python -m playwright install
chromium``, which downloads the browser binary that ``playwright``
itself can't bring along.

The "gui" extra deliberately has no registry entry: if the user is
looking at this dialog, wxPython is already importable.
