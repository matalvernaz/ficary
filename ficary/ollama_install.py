"""Install Ollama from inside ficary on Windows via ``winget``.

The LLM author's-note backstop and the audiobook attribution backend
both default to a local Ollama daemon. New users who tick "Use LLM"
without realising they need a separate installer hit a 116-line
"connection refused" wall — the same bug the 2.2.6 circuit breaker
papered over after the fact. The settings dialog now offers a
one-click install that wraps Microsoft's package manager (built into
Windows 10 1809+ / Windows 11) so the user doesn't have to leave the
app, hunt down ``OllamaSetup.exe``, click through SmartScreen, and
come back.

Pure helpers — no GUI deps, callable from a worker thread, every
network or subprocess hop wrapped in a callback so the dialog can
stream progress to a read-only text control. Linux/macOS get a
graceful "not supported here, use the web installer" path because
``winget`` is Windows-only.
