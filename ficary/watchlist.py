"""Fanfiction watchlist with notifications.

Stores a list of things the user wants pushed to them when they change:

* **Story watches** — new chapter alerts on a specific work (uses each
  scraper's cheap :py:meth:`BaseScraper.get_chapter_count` probe).
* **Author watches** — new-work alerts for a specific author (uses
  :py:meth:`BaseScraper.scrape_author_works` on every supported site).
* **Search watches** — new-match alerts for a saved query on a specific
  site (uses the site-specific ``search.search_<site>`` function).

All three share the same polling loop, the same storage, and the same
notification dispatcher in :mod:`ficary.notifications`.

Storage is a JSON file at ``<portable_root>/watchlist.json`` so the
user's entries survive auto-updates (the release zip contains only the
exe + ``_internal/`` and doesn't overwrite user data). The file is
versioned for forward compatibility; unknown fields on disk are
ignored, missing fields fall back to dataclass defaults, and a
malformed file is quarantined with a ``.corrupt-<timestamp>`` suffix so
the rest of the app keeps running.

The runner never crashes: per-watch scraper/network failures are
captured on the watch itself (``last_error``) and surfaced in the
returned :class:`PollResult` list so the caller — CLI or GUI — can
report them without losing the rest of the poll. Notification
failures (a broken Discord webhook, a Pushover rate-limit) are
likewise captured per-channel by :func:`notifications.dispatch` and
logged, so one misconfigured channel can't silence the others.
