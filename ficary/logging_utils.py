"""Cross-cutting logging helpers.

Correlation IDs
===============

A library-wide update run produces thousands of log lines from every
scraper, the cache, the exporter, and the library refresh code —
interleaved if anything runs concurrently (AO3's bookmark pagination,
the parallel probe pool in ``--update-all``). Debugging "why did these
seven stories fail last night?" used to mean grepping a timestamp
range and eyeballing which lines went with which story.

This module adds a per-download correlation ID so every log line
emitted while working on a single story carries the same short tag.
A caller wrapping the download in :func:`correlation_context` gets
output like::

    [dl-a83f4c21] Fetching FFN story 12345 metadata...
    [dl-a83f4c21] Downloading FFN 12345: 'Some Title' by X (12 chapters)
    [dl-a83f4c21] Rate limited (HTTP 429), waiting 37s (attempt 1/5)

It's a pure-addition feature: scrapers keep using
``logging.getLogger(__name__)`` unchanged, and when no context is
active the tag simply doesn't appear. The filter is installed on the
``ficary`` package logger at import time, so any child logger picks
it up automatically. That's important — I'm not going to touch every
``logger.info`` call in the scraper modules just to wire this up.

Implementation notes:

* Uses ``contextvars`` so concurrent threads each see their own
  correlation ID. The parallel chapter fetcher in ``BaseScraper``
  inherits the parent's context under Python's default ``copy_context``
  behaviour, so chapter logs end up tagged with the same story ID as
  the metadata fetch that kicked them off — which is what we want.
* Short IDs (8 hex chars) are long enough for a library update pass
  of a few hundred stories to avoid birthday collisions and short
  enough not to wreck the log layout.
