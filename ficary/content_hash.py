"""Chapter-content hashing for silent-edit detection.

Fanfiction authors revise chapters in place — fixing typos, tweaking
dialogue, sometimes rewriting whole scenes — without bumping the
chapter count. A count-based update check (``--update-library``'s
current default) can't see those edits, and the local copy drifts
from whatever's canon upstream. Over months this turns into "wait,
that paragraph was different" for readers with long libraries.

This module hashes each chapter's HTML body so a later comparison
can tell whether the upstream content has changed even when the
chapter count hasn't. The stored hash lives next to the other
per-story metadata in the library index; the scanner and refresh
paths read/write it the same way they read/write ``chapter_count``.

Design notes:

* **Light normalisation only.** We collapse whitespace runs and trim
  outer whitespace. We deliberately *don't* re-parse through
  BeautifulSoup or a DOM normaliser — that would couple the hash to
  whichever parser version ficary ships, so upgrading ``lxml`` would
  invalidate every stored hash in every library on the next check.
  The whitespace pass catches the one real false-positive pattern:
  re-formatted HTML (pretty-printer output, tab↔space differences
  between exporters) that doesn't actually change the prose.

* **SHA-256.** Cryptographic-strength isn't the point — collision
  resistance against a motivated attacker doesn't matter for
  fanfiction — but SHA-256 is stdlib, fast enough on a chapter-sized
  input (microseconds), and the output is short enough (64 hex) to
  store comfortably in the library index JSON.

* **Order matters.** Hashes are always taken in chapter-number
  order, so a library entry's ``chapter_hashes[i]`` corresponds to
  ``chapter_count`` position ``i+1``. An out-of-order chapter list
  would otherwise produce different hashes on redownload even
  without any real edit.

    2. Drop whitespace that sits *between* tag boundaries (``>\\s+<``

       without actually changing the prose — the most common trigger
       for a false-positive silent-edit flag.

    We deliberately keep whitespace that borders text content so a
    real edit that inserts or removes a space (e.g. ``"its"`` →
