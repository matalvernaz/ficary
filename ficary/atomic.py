"""Atomic file writes.

A crash (OS kill, power loss, user Ctrl-C mid-export) is much more
likely to happen during a long-running ficary run than is obvious — a
library-wide update hits hundreds of file writes, and losing one to a
half-written file corrupts the entry silently. The symptoms then show
up later as "why is this EPUB unreadable?" or "why did the next scan
mark this story as untrackable?"

This module centralises the write-to-tmp, fsync, rename-over-target
idiom so every file the program persists lands whole-or-not-at-all.
Before this existed, only ``LibraryIndex.save`` and ``watchlist.save``
bothered; exporters and the scraper cache wrote directly to the
destination, and an interrupted export left a partial file sitting in
the library.

Design notes:

* The rename is atomic on POSIX and (since Python 3.3) on Windows when
  ``os.replace`` is used. We never use ``os.rename`` here because it
  fails if the destination exists on Windows.

* ``fsync`` on the temp file forces pending page-cache data to disk
  before the rename is committed, so a power loss between the rename
  and the actual data hitting the platter still leaves either the old
  file or the new one — never garbage.

* We do *not* fsync the enclosing directory. On ext4 + most journalled
  filesystems the rename itself is journalled and durable; the extra
  sync would double the wall time of a library-wide export run for a
  guarantee users don't need (the index is our source of truth; a
  missing file just triggers a re-download). If a durability-critical
  caller ever needs it, pass ``fsync_dir=True``.
