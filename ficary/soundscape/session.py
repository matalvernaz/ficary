"""Bridges reader lifecycle events to the shared engine's ambient channel.

Subscribes to the audio engine's event bus and reacts by calling engine mixer
methods only (fade in on open, duck under narration, restore, fade out on
close) — no wx, so it's safe off the GUI thread.

Sources are built on a worker thread: adding a looping source decodes the
file through ffmpeg, which is seconds of subprocess time for long ambience —
blocking the GUI thread (where READER_OPENED is emitted from) froze the
reader window on open. A build generation token keeps a teardown that races
a still-running build from resurrecting its sources.
