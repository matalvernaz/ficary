"""Playwright-backed Cloudflare challenge solver for stubborn 403s.

FFN's Cloudflare deployment occasionally refuses every impersonated
``curl_cffi`` request with a first-contact 403 — browser rotation
and client-hint injection mostly handle it, but a bad-fingerprint day
makes every retry fail and the retry loop just burns time. This
module provides a real-browser fallback: open the URL in Playwright,
let Cloudflare's challenge JavaScript run to completion, and hand the
solved ``cf_clearance`` cookie back to the caller. The curl session
then injects the cookie and retries; subsequent chapters reuse it
from the persisted cookie jar without another Playwright run.

The fallback is strictly opt-in — Playwright ships a ~300MB browser
binary and requires ``playwright install chromium`` before first use.
Most users never need it; the feature exists for the "bad day" case
where the built-in mitigations aren't enough.

Cookies are persisted per-host under the scraper cache dir so a
second invocation of ficary doesn't re-run Playwright for the same
host. The TTL is short (24h, since Cloudflare's cf_clearance rotates
that frequently) to prevent stale tokens from silently causing every
request to 403 after the challenge would have expired anyway.
