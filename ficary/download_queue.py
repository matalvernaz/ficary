"""Per-site download queue for concurrent cross-site downloads.

Every supported site gets its own FIFO queue and a lazily-spawned
worker thread. Jobs enqueued for the same site run serially — so a
single scraper's rate-limit floor (FFN's 6s, AO3's default pacing) is
honoured — while jobs on different sites run in parallel. That is,
checking for updates on a library of 800 FFN stories no longer blocks
a one-off AO3 download from the URL bar.

Every download entry point funnels through this module: manual
downloads, file updates, voice previews, the clipboard watcher, and
the library-update Phase 3 loop. That way the manual and update-all
code paths share one serialization policy per site, rather than
each running its own parallel worker on top of the other and
tripping the site's rate limit.

Worker threads are named ``dlq-<site_name>``. The GUI's log helpers
inspect :func:`threading.current_thread` to auto-prefix status lines
with ``[<SITE>] ``, so the single shared log pane stays readable when
two sites are emitting progress concurrently.
