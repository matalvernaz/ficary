"""Pluggable text-to-speech providers for audiobook synthesis.

Two providers ship in-tree:

- ``edge`` — Microsoft Edge Neural Voices via ``edge-tts``. Cloud TTS
  (the same backend powering Edge's "Read aloud"), no API key, broad
  English-locale coverage. This is the historical default and the one
  every existing voice map JSON file points at.
- ``piper`` — Rhasspy's Piper TTS, local ONNX inference. Ships nothing
  by default; voices are downloaded on first use into the portable
  ``piper_models/`` folder. Works fully offline once a model is in
  place.

A provider exposes:

    name:     str
    is_installed() -> bool
    list_voices() -> list[VoiceInfo]
    synthesize(text, voice_short_name, *, rate, volume, pitch, output_path)

The dispatcher namespaces every voice id as ``"<provider>:<short_name>"``
so a voice-map JSON entry survives a provider swap. For backwards
compatibility, bare names (no colon) are treated as ``edge:`` — every
voice map written before 2.2.0 still resolves correctly.
