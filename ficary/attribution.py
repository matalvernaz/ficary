"""Pluggable speaker-attribution backends for audiobook generation.

The built-in pipeline in `tts.py` already parses dialogue and assigns
speakers via regex + heuristics. For tougher cases (pronoun-heavy
prose, unconventional attribution, dense multi-speaker scenes) users
can opt into a neural refinement pass that runs after `parse_segments`.

Backends ship as optional extras — the core ficary install never
requires them. Each backend exposes:

    - is_installed() → bool  (fast, import-free check)
    - refine(segments, full_text) → list[Segment]  (returns new list;
      may mutate segments in place)

`refine_speakers(segments, full_text, backend)` is the main dispatcher;
unknown or uninstalled backends degrade silently to the builtin no-op.

# ── Post-attribution refinement ────────────────────────────────────
#
# These passes run on the combined per-chapter segment lists after the
# chosen backend (builtin or neural) has attributed what it can. They
# target two pattern classes that both backends struggle with:
#
# 1. *Self-introductions* — "I'm Ron, by the way, Ron Weasley." BookNLP
#    coref can only link quotes to entities it has already seen; the
#    first line of a new character introducing themselves therefore
#    tends to get stuck on the previous speaker by carryforward.
#
# 2. *Junk speakers* from BookNLP's PROP entity detection — capitalised
#    spell names / species / places ("Cruciatus", "Veela", "Wizard",
#    "Barrier", "Scroll", "Unknown"…) occasionally win a quote
#    attribution in fantasy prose. Anything single-word that only
#    appears once in the entire book and matches our common-noun
#    blocklist gets demoted back to narrator.


# Common capitalised fanfic-prose nouns BookNLP sometimes mis-tags as
# speakers. Kept lowercase; check is case-insensitive. Deliberately
# narrow — names like "Dragon", "Phoenix", "Raven" CAN be real character
# names (Reyna, Fleur, Percy Jackson fic, DCU fic), so the demotion only
# fires when the speaker also appears exactly once in the whole book.

    errors, non-2xx responses, or unsupported providers.

    ``response_schema`` is an optional JSON Schema describing the exact
    shape the reply must take. When provided:

    * **Ollama** (``format`` accepts a JSON Schema since v0.5) sends
      the schema verbatim, which constrains the model's output at
      decode time. This is the difference between qwen2.5:14b
      respecting the prompt and qwen2.5:14b inventing its own
      scene-summary schema.
    * **OpenAI** and openai-compatible endpoints fall back to
      ``response_format: {"type": "json_object"}`` — the strict
      ``json_schema`` mode requires every property to be ``required``
      and ``additionalProperties: false`` everywhere, which is too
      brittle to maintain alongside the schema we'd generate. The
      free-form ``json_object`` mode plus the parser fallbacks in
      :func:`_parse_an_response` is sufficient for the providers we've
      seen comply with the prompt.
    * **Anthropic** ignores the schema (no native structured-output
      support over the ``/messages`` endpoint at the time of writing);
      the parser fallbacks handle the well-behaved JSON responses
      Claude already produces.

    ``cache_system`` opts the call into Anthropic prompt caching by
    sending ``system`` as a content list with a ``cache_control:
    ephemeral`` marker. Caching only actually engages when the system
    prompt clears Anthropic's per-block minimum (1024 tokens for
    Sonnet/Opus 4.x, 2048 for Haiku); below that the marker is
    silently ignored. The current call sites all use shorter prompts,
    so this is wired infrastructure rather than active behaviour —
    flip the flag at a call site once the prompt at that site grows
    past the threshold. OpenAI's prefix cache fires automatically on
    identical ≥1024-token prefixes, so we don't need a flag for it.
    Ollama doesn't expose prompt caching as a separate API.

    Ollama calls request a 30-minute :data:`_OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE_DEFAULT`
    keep_alive window — strictly looser than Ollama's stock 5-minute
    eviction, which routinely unloads the model partway through a
