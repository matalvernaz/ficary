"""Library integrity check and self-heal.

Over the life of a library — hundreds of stories, scan-then-update
cycles, the occasional manual file reorganisation — the index on disk
and the files on disk drift apart. Symptoms:

* A story is moved to a new folder; the index still points at the
  old relpath and subsequent library updates silently skip it.
* A file is deleted outside the app; the index still lists it and the
  next rescan has to rediscover that the story is gone.
* Someone drops an EPUB into the library folder by hand; the
  downloader doesn't know about it and won't update it.
* mtime/size cached on the entry is out of step with the real file,
  which defeats the refresh path's "skip unchanged" optimisation and
  makes every library update re-parse every story.

This module produces a structured report describing all four drift
types, and a small set of mutation helpers for fixing each one. The
reporter never mutates the index — callers see the full picture
before committing to a heal, and can pick which categories to act on.

Usage sketch::

    idx = LibraryIndex.load()
    report = check_integrity(root, idx)
    if not report.is_clean():
        print(report.summary())
        healed = heal(root, idx, report, scan_orphans=True,
                      drop_missing=True, refresh_drift=True)
        idx.save()
        print(healed.summary())
