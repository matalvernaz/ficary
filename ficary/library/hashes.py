"""Library-level glue for chapter content hashes.

The pure hashing primitives live in :mod:`ficary.content_hash` — this
module ties them to the library index and to the on-disk story files
so the CLI's ``--populate-hashes`` and ``--scan-edits`` flows don't
need to know anything beyond "read hashes for this entry", "write
hashes for this entry".

Two entry points matter:

* :func:`compute_local_hashes` parses a local export file (EPUB or
  HTML) back into chapters and hashes each. Used by the bootstrap
  path to backfill hashes for stories downloaded before this feature
  shipped, and by the detection path as the local side of the
  comparison.
* :func:`store_hashes` writes a hash list onto a library-index entry
  without disturbing the rest of the entry's fields. ``index.save()``
  is the caller's responsibility — so a batch bootstrap can write
  once at the end instead of N times.
