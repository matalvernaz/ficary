    Each queue entry has ``path``, ``rel`` (display name), ``url``,
    ``local`` — the same shape ``cli._run_update_queue`` expects.
    Chapter counts come from disk when we can read them; fall back
    to the index's recorded count so foreign-format files (where
    ``count_chapters`` returns 0 because the HTML markers don't
    match) still get compared against the remote.

    When ``recheck_interval_s`` is positive, stories whose index
    ``last_probed`` timestamp is newer than ``now - recheck_interval_s``
    are skipped with a clear message — the TTL makes a second
    ``--update-library`` run inside the window near-instant instead
    of re-hitting the network for every story. ``0`` (the CLI default)
    preserves the pre-TTL behaviour so scripted callers don't change
    behaviour without opting in.

    ``skip_complete`` (default on) drops any entry whose index
    ``status`` is Complete, Completed, or Abandoned. The check is
    a single dict lookup — no disk read — so adding it to a 1000-
    story refresh costs nothing while saving the upstream probe for
    every finished fic. ``--force-recheck`` (CLI) and the GUI's
    Force-recheck checkbox flip this off. Pending-resume entries
    (``remote_chapter_count > local``) bypass the gate so an owed
    download still lands.

    ``skip_stale_complete_days`` is a gentler companion to
    ``skip_complete``: it skips a story only when it's both marked
    Complete *and* its file has been untouched for that many days.
    Mostly redundant now that ``skip_complete`` is the default —
    kept for callers that explicitly opt out of the blanket skip
    but still want the stale-only behaviour. ``0`` disables the
    gate; a pending-resume entry bypasses it.

    ``skip_abandoned`` (default on) drops any entry carrying an
    ``abandoned_at`` timestamp — set by ``--mark-abandoned-after``
    or the programmatic :func:`mark_abandoned` helper — from the
    queue. Intent: once the user has declared a WIP dead, stop
    spending HTTP probes on it until they revive it explicitly.
