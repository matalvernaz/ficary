"""Full-text search over library chapter content.

``--library-find`` is a metadata-only surface — title, author, fandom,
URL. It can't answer "which fic had that scene at the orphanage?"
because the chapter bodies never make it into the index. This module
maintains a SQLite FTS5 index built from the same library files the
metadata index already tracks, so the question becomes a single query.

Design notes:

* **One SQLite file, one virtual table.** FTS5 supports UNINDEXED
  columns inline with indexed ones; that lets every retrieval go
  through the same row without a join. The DB lives in the portable
  root next to ``library-index.json`` so a portable-layout install
  keeps everything under one folder.

* **Plain text, not HTML.** We strip tags before indexing — a user
  searching for ``"shouted at the dragon"`` shouldn't have the match
  blocked by a ``<em>``. The strip uses BeautifulSoup in the same
  "get_text with a separator" shape the exporters already use, so a
  paragraph tag becomes a visible boundary rather than a word run-on.

* **Whole-story upserts.** Indexing is per-story: re-indexing a story
  drops every existing row for that ``(root, url)`` pair and inserts
  fresh rows for each chapter. Authors revising chapter 4 in place
  still land correctly because the old chapter 4 rows are gone before
  the new ones go in. The full-rebuild cost is a few milliseconds per
  story at chapter-size; bigger than a targeted update but far
  simpler to keep consistent.

* **Stored lightly.** The FTS5 table only carries what the CLI needs
  to render a hit: story identity (root + url + relpath), chapter
  position (number + title), and the body. Richer metadata lives in
  the library index — the CLI look-up resolves hits against that.
