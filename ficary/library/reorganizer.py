"""Plan and apply file moves to align a library with its path template.

Two-step: plan() returns a list of MoveOps the caller can show to the
user; apply() executes a (possibly filtered) subset. Keeping them
separate is what makes the CLI's dry-run mode and the GUI's per-row
checkbox review work off the same engine.

plan() reads only the library index, so run --scan-library first. Any
file not in the index is invisible to the reorganizer — it won't be
moved, but it won't be cleaned up either.
