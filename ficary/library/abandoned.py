"""Mark, revive, and list abandoned-WIP stories in the library index.

A WIP fic (status != Complete) that hasn't had a new chapter in
years is, practically speaking, dead. ``--update-library`` was
still probing them on every run — one HTTP probe per story per run
to discover nothing has changed, which adds up fast on a library of
thousands of fics where a significant fraction are long-abandoned.

This module lets the user declare a WIP dead by stamping an
``abandoned_at`` ISO timestamp on its library-index entry.
``build_refresh_queue`` skips any entry with that field set, so
subsequent update runs stop spending probes on abandoned work.
Reviving (unmarking) one or all stories is a single CLI flag away
— there's no delete step, just a flag flip, so a silently-restored
author's update path stays painless.

Two signals determine abandonment in the auto-mark sweep:

1. **Status is NOT Complete** — finished fics are the
   ``--skip-stale-complete`` feature's territory. Abandonment is
   specifically about WIPs the author has walked away from.
2. **File mtime is older than ``days`` days.** The local file's
   last-written time is the best proxy for "when did a new chapter
   land" that we have without introducing a new tracked field.
   A fic we re-downloaded yesterday isn't abandoned even if its
   first chapter went up a decade ago.

Existing ``abandoned_at`` entries are not re-stamped; the mark is
sticky until ``revive_abandoned`` clears it.
