"""Render a library-relative path from a file's metadata.

Pure function — no I/O, no file moves. The caller decides whether
to write to this path or just record it.

Template placeholders:
    {fandom}   — single fandom name, or the misc folder for multi-
                 fandom and no-fandom stories
    {title}
    {author}
    {ext}      — "epub" | "html" | "txt"

    {status}   — "Unknown" when absent

Forward slash in the template separates path components. Slashes that
appear inside a placeholder value (e.g. a title literally containing
"/") are scrubbed out before substitution so they can't accidentally
split a field across directories.
